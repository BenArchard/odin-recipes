    <h3>You’ll make these flavorful chicken kabobs all summer long.</h3>
    
    <p>One of my go-to chicken recipes for summer cookouts, these Middle-Eastern style grilled chicken kabobs are wonderful over a bed of rice pilaf or served with a Greek salad. The chicken is marinated in yogurt, olive oil, lemon, garlic and spices, and then grilled over an open flame until juicy and golden brown. The only time-consuming part of the recipe is threading the meat and onions onto skewers.</p>
    <p>Short on time? Skip the skewers and grill the chicken pieces whole, and slice the red onions into large wedges and pop them right on the grill. A word to the wise: make more than you think you’ll need. The first time I made these chicken kabobs for a crowd, I actually ran out of food!</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>100ml yoghurt</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
    </ul> 

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic.</li>
        <li>Trim the chicken of any excess fat and gristle. Don’t worry about getting every last bit of fat; most of it will melt off on the grill. Then cut the meat into bite-size pieces. I think it’s easiest to use kitchen shears as opposed to a knife.</li>
        <li>Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers alternating with the red onions. Metal skewers are ideal as they won’t catch fire on the grill. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes first so they’re slower to char on the grill.</li>
    </ol>
