            <ol>
                <li>Start by combining the breadcrumbs, milk, egg, garlic powder, onion powder and all spice in a bowl and allow the mixture to absorb for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once it’s absorbed a bit, add in the ground beef, ground pork and parsley, mixing with clean hands and shaping into balls.</li>
                <li>Heat some oil and butter on the stove top and fry the meatballs (or bake) until cooked through.</li>
            </ol>
